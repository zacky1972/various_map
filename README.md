# VariousMap

Map implementations in various ways.

## Installation

You can add `various_map` as dependencies in your `mix.exs`. At the moment you will have to use a Git dependency while we work on our first release:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:various_map, "~> 0.1", github: "zacky1972/various_map"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) by `mix docs`.
